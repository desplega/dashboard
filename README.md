# [dashboard - Practical Internet of Things with Javascript]

The book "Practical Internet of Things with Javascript by Arvind Ravulavaru" consists of three main parts:
* IoTFW (server)
* dashboard
* device

This is the implementation of the dashboard based on that book.
The book uses Angular as the frontend framework, however I have used Vue.

Vue Material Dashboard is a beautiful resource built over [Vue Material](https://vuematerial.io/) and [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/).
This is the Dashboard template used for the project.
